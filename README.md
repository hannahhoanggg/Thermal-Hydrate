# Thermal-Hydrate 

A full stack web application for health enthusiasts who want to purchase different brands of insulated tumblers.

## Purpose Behind The Application 

The purpose behind creating this website was to improve my own health by staying hydrated and drinking more water. As I explored various insulated tumbler brands, my interest grew, and I realized that there was a need for a platform where people could access a variety of brands in one place. So, I developed this website to provide others with the option to choose from multiple tumbler brands and expand their choices beyond just one primary brand.
